# Basic Keylogger

This project is a simple GUI-based keylogger built using Python and the `tkinter` and `pynput` libraries. The keylogger captures keystrokes, displays them in real-time, and provides options to save or clear the logged data.

---

## Features

- **Start and Stop Keylogger:** Easily control keylogging using GUI buttons.
- **Real-Time Display:** View logged keys with timestamps in the GUI.
- **Save Logs:** Export logs to a `.txt` or `.csv` file.
- **Clear Logs:** Clear logs from the display and memory.

## How It Works

1. **Keylogging Control:**
   - Click **Start Keylogger** to begin logging keystrokes.
   - Click **Stop Keylogger** to stop logging.
2. **Real-Time Display:** Captures and displays keystrokes in the GUI window.
3. **Log Management:**
   - Save logs to a `.txt` or `.csv` file using the **Save Logs** button.
   - Clear all logs using the **Clear Logs** button.
